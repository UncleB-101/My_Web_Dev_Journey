        At Brittle Farm, we have aligned our business models with Sustainable Development Goal 2, to end all forms of hunger while promoting food security across the globe.
         Our tech-infused platform drives an enabling environment for farmers and sets up more efficient food distribution channels.
          We have also developed two Strategic Business Units, FC Foods and FC Shops, that facilitate stakeholder access to maximum profitability in the food value chain.
