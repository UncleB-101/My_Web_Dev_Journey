     <p><h3>  What we are all about</h3></p>
        <h1>Our Core Values </h1>

        <h3>Humility</h3>
In achieving success, we can never underestimate the value of our personnel, farmers and farm sponsors. Therefore to each one, we accord Respect and Humility.

<h3>Hunger</h3>
Our people have a ‘Hunger for More’ attitude which can drive us to eradicate ‘Hunger for All’. We must be seen as people who are constantly and consistently thinking out of the box.

<h3>Excellence</h3>
We embrace excellence in order to create better ways of doing the things we do. Excellence for us is not a watchword, it’s an intrinsic habit. It’s the default mode for all our operational standards so that mediocrity and half-measure become alien to our culture.
   
<h3>Integrity</h3>
At Farmcrowdy we do not only comply with regulations, good business practices and ethical standards, but we are also honest, reliable, and trustworthy people. We project these standards when dealing with farmers and farm sponsors.

<h3>People-Smart</h3>
We have Interpersonal Intelligence and are constantly seeking ways of improving relationships with our personnel, farmers and farm sponsors. This allows us to effectively communicate with clarity.

<h3> Fun</h3>
All Work and no Play will not only make us dull but will dampen our creative talents. Having fun allows us to be flexible and also creates an enabling environment where we can exhale every once in a while.

<h2>Celebrating National Digital Agriculture Day</h2>

 The National Digital Agriculture Day in Nigeria is a chance to join hands with other agritech startups on the path of breathing new life into agriculture, by supporting even more smallholder farmers and increasing food production not only in Nigeria but across Africa.
